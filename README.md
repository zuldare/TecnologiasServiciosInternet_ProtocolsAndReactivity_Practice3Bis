# Work to do

An application containing the following services is to be created:
- Client
- Server
- Worker
- External Service 1
- External Service 2

The following diagram shows how this services communicate among them.

## Client
- It will be executed on a web browser
- It will be able to invoke an API REST provided by _server_.
- It will connect using _WebSocket_ in order to receive messages with the progress of the task launched.
- Whan a task is created, a text to the _server_ is send.
- It will be served as static http in the _server's web server_.
- It will be implementes as AJAX: JavaScript code calling the API REST and the _server's websockets endpoint_.
- Client's web will show the already executed task in e server and the progress of each one of them at the requested moment.
- It also will have a form in order to include text and a button in order to create a task with that name. When this button is pushed a REST request will be done to the _server_ to ask for the execution of that task. The response of that creation response will return inmediatelly returning a *0% progress*. The creation will progress in the _server_ some additional seconds.
- As the task's execution progresses _Client_ will receive messages through the websocket with the progress. The web site must show this progress. A "Progress: XX%" is enough.
- The interface will only allow to create one task at a time. In order to do that it will disable the button until completed.
- When the progress message reaches 100% the list of tasks will be updated.
- The web will be available in _http://127.0.0.1:3000_

## Server
# Usage

## Environment configuration
It is compulsory to launch the following commands in order to create the docker containers

### Creating the MongoDB container
- In shell:
    ```shell script
    $ docker run --name mongo-db  -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest
    ```
  
### Creating the MySQL container
- In shell:
    ```shell script
    $ docker run --name mysql-db -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=tasksDB -d mysql:latest
    ```
  
### Creating the RabbitMQ container
- In shell:
    ```shell script
    $ docker run --name rabbitMQ -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -d rabbitmq:3-management
    ```
